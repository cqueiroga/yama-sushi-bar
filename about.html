  <div class="about" id="about">
    <p class="about-col">Welcome to Yama Sushi Bar! We have just recently opened a restaurant located in Glen Burnie, MD. Since the opening of the restaurant we have set
	our goal to create the best sushi in town and provide the best customer experience we can. We think our customers will be satisfied as soon as they step foot through
	our door until they leave. We provide a fun and friendly atmosphere with wonderful presentation with each dish. If you don't believe us, then please come see for yourself.
	I guarantee it won't be your last visit!</p>
    <p class="about-col">Hi, my name is Chris Queiroga! I have designed this site for Yama Sushi Bar because I feel like they need to get more recognition for their amazing service and food.
	I have been to this restaurant multiple times and every time I have gone the service they provide was incredible. They didn't have a website at the time, so I felt that the
	best way to get their name out there is to create one for them. If other people are searching the internet for local restaurants then they have a better chance at getting noticed
	then not having one. I hope everyone including Yama Sushi Bar likes the site and hopefully as time goes on and my skills get better we will be able to improve the site. Thank you
	for stopping by!</p>
